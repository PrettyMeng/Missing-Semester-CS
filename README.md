# Missing-Semester-CS

My personal note about the course: [The Missing Semester of Your CS Education.](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/)

The note is short and compact, which does not include every detail in the lecture. It only focuses on the part that I'm not familiar with but seems to be useful. It refers to the official note but also marks several points mentioned in the lectures.
