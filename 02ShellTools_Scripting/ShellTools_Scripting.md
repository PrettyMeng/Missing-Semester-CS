# Shell Tools and Scripting

## Shell Scripting

### Why shell scripting?

* Optimized for performing shell-related tasks than other general programming languages
  * Creating command pipelines
  * Saving results into files
  * Reading from standard input

### Assign variable in bash

*  `foo=bar`, `foo = bar` will not work because foo would be interpreted as a program.

### Define string with '' or "":

```bash
foo=bar
echo "$foo"
# prints bar
echo '$foo'
# prints $foo
```

### Define functions

*  let's say we have a file named mcd.sh:

```bash
mcd () {
    mkdir -p "$1"
    cd "$1"
}
```

* Then we can do the following:

```bash
source mcd.sh
mcd test
```

This will `mkdir` a directory named test and `cd` into it.

### Special Variables

* `$0`: Name of the script
* `$1` to `$9`: Arguments to the script. `$1` is the first argument
* `$@`: All the arguments
* `$#`: Number of arguments
* `$?`: Return/Error code of the previous command. 0 means everything is OK; anything else means an error occured.
* `$$`: Process indentification number (PID) for the current script 
* `!!`: Entire last command, including arguments. A common pattern is to execute a command only for it to fail due to missing permissions; you can quickly re-execute the command with sudo by doing `sudo !!`
* `$_`: Last argument from the last command. If you are in an interactive shell, you can also quickly get this value by typing `Esc` followed by `.`

* More can be found [here](https://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/special-chars.html).

### Logical operators with **short-circuiting** features

* `;`: for separating commands

```bash
false || echo "Oops, fail"
# Oops, fail

true || echo "Will not be printed"
#

true && echo "Things went well"
# Things went well

false && echo "Will not be printed"
#

true ; echo "This will always run"
# This will always run

false ; echo "This will always run"
# This will always run
```

### Get the output of a command as a variable/file

* `xargs`: convert `stdin` to command line arguments
  * command line arguments: will not block the shell
  * `stdin` will block the shell if the input is empty

* Command substition: `$(CMD)` will execute `CMD` and substitute it in place
  * e.g. `for file in $(ls)`: Iterate the output of `ls`
* Process substitution: `<(CMD)` will execute `CMD` and place the output in a temporary file and substitute the `<()` with that file's name. Useful when commands expect values to be passed by file instead of STDIN.
  * e.g. `diff <(ls foo) <(ls bar) `: show differences between files in dirs `foo` and `bar`

### A comprehensive example

```bash
#!/bin/bash

echo "Starting program at $(date)" # Date will be substituted

echo "Running program $0 with $# arguments with pid $$"

for file in "$@"; do
    grep foobar "$file" > /dev/null 2> /dev/null
    # When pattern is not found, grep has exit status 1
    # We redirect STDOUT and STDERR to a null register since we do not care about them
    if [[ $? -ne 0 ]]; then
        echo "File $file does not have any foobar, adding one"
        echo "# foobar" >> "$file"
    fi
done
```

* `> /dev/null` and `2> /dev/null` for not printing STDOUT and STDERR
* Use double brackets `[[]]` when performing comparisons.

### Shell *globbing*

* Wildcard

  * `?`: One character
  * `*`: Zero or more character
  * Given files `foo`, `foo1`, `foo2`, `foo10` and `bar`
    * `rm foo?`: will delete `foo1` and `foo2`
    * `rm foo*`: will delete all but `bar`

* Curly braces `{} `: expand a common substring automatically

  * ```bash
    convert image.{png,jpg}
    # Will expand to
    convert image.png image.jpg
    ```

  * ```bash
    cp /path/to/project/{foo,bar,baz}.sh /newpath
    # Will expand to
    cp /path/to/project/foo.sh /path/to/project/bar.sh /path/to/project/baz.sh /newpath
    ```

  * ```bash
    # Globbing techniques can also be combined
    mv *{.py,.sh} folder
    # Will move all *.py and *.sh files
    ```

  * ```bash
    mkdir foo bar
    # This creates files foo/a, foo/b, ... foo/h, bar/a, bar/b, ... bar/h
    touch {foo,bar}/{a..h}
    touch foo/x bar/y
    # Show differences between files in foo and bar
    diff <(ls foo) <(ls bar)
    # Outputs
    # < x
    # ---
    # > y
    ```

### [Shellcheck](https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck) 

* To help you find errors in sh/bash scripts

### Shebang

* Shell scripts are not necessarily be written in bash, use **shebang** to specify the interpreter

  ```bash
  #!/usr/local/bin/python
  import sys
  for arg in reversed(sys.argv[1:]):
      print(arg)
  ```

* A better practice is to specify the interpreter using the `env` command: `#!/usr/bin/env python` to resolve the location automatically

### Difference between functions and scripts

* Functions have to be in the same language as the shell, while scripts can be written in any language. This is why including a shebang for scripts is important.
* Functions are executed in the current shell environment whereas scripts execute in their own process. Thus, functions can modify environment variables, e.g. change your current directory, whereas scripts canâ€™t. Scripts will be passed by value environment variables that have been exported using `export`.

## Shell Tools

### Documentation about how to use commands

* `-h` or `--help`: brief introduction about how to use
* `man`: full documentation, but may be overly detailed
* `tldr`: a more nifty solution, provide several common examples

### Finding files matching some criteria

* `find`

```bash
# Find all directories named src
find . -name src -type d
# Find all python files that have a folder named test in their path
find . -path '*/test/*.py' -type f
# Find all files modified in the last day
find . -mtime -1
# Find all zip files with size in range 500k to 10M
find . -size +500k -size -10M -name '*.tar.gz'
```

Besides listing files, `find` can also perform actions over files that match the query.

```bash
# Delete all files with .tmp extension
find . -name '*.tmp' -exec rm {} \;
# Find all PNG files and convert them to JPG
find . -name '*.png' -exec convert {} {}.jpg \;
```

* `fd`
```bash
# a simple, fast, and user-friendly alternative to `find`
fd 'PATTERN' = find -name '*PATTERN*'
# Find all python files
fd '.*.py'
```

* `locate`
  * Use a database and thus **faster** to search for files. The database is updated by `updateb`, which is perform daily. 
  * Compared with `find`, **can only search via file name**.

### Finding code

* `grep`
  * `-C`: Getting **C**ontext around the matching line. e.g. `-C 5` will print 5 lines before and after the match.
  * `-v`: In**v**erting the match, print all lines that do not match the pattern
  * `-R`: **R**ecursively go into directories and look for files for the matching string
* `rg` (ripgrep): ignore `.git` folders and using multi CPU support
  * `-t`: Specify a type. e.g. `-t py`	
  * `-u`: Include hidden files
  * `--file-without-matching`:Find files that do not have the pattern
  * `-A`: print the following lines of the pattern
  * Examples:

```bash
# Find all python files where I used the requests library in a specified folder
rg -t py 'import requests' ~/scratch
# Find all files (including hidden files `-u`) without a shebang line
rg -u --files-without-match "^#!"
# Find all matches of foo and print the following 5 lines
rg foo -A 5
# Print statistics of matches (# of matched lines and files )
rg --stats PATTERN
```

### Finding commands

* `histroy`: List your previous commands. 

  * `histroy | grep find` will print commands that contain the substring "find"
  * `histroy 10` will print the previous 10 commands

* `ctrl+R`: search through the histroy with a give substring

* `fzf`: do the fuzzy matching instead of exact matching

  ```bash
  cat example.sh | fzf
  #substringToFind
  ```

* histroy-based autosuggestions: can be enabled in zsh

### Directory navigation

* Several useful tools to browse the file structure:
  * `tree` `ls -R`
  * `broot	`
  * `nnn`: also shows hidden files in the directory

* `fasd`

  Adds a `z` command that you can use to quickly `cd` using a substring of a *frecent* directory. For example, if you often go to `/home/user/files/cool_project` you can simply use `z cool` to jump there

## Exercise

* An `ls` command in the following manner:
  * Includes all files, including hidden files
  * Sizes are listed in human readable format (e.g. 454M instead of 454279954)
  * Files are ordered by recency
  * Output is colorized

```bash
ls -a -h -t -color
```

* Write a simple script defining functions in VSCode:

  Modify **CRLF** to **LF** in the bottom to turn "\r\n" to "\n"

* Testing a file that possibly fails with a loop

  *  *for* ((count=1;;count++))
  * *count=1* ... while true ... ((count++))

  * add one to a variable:
    * a=\$((\$a+1))  
    * a=\$[\$a+1]
    * let a++
    * let a+=1

* Use `xargs` to pass arguments originally separated by '\n'

  ```bash
  find . -type f -name "*.html" | xargs -d '\n'  tar -cvzf html.zip
  ```

* Find the most recent file

  ```bash
  find . -type f | xargs -d '\n' ls -lt | head -1
  find . -type f -print0 | xargs -0 ls -lt | head -1
  ```

  * `-print0` for `find` corresponds to `-0` for `xargs`
